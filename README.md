# Galapagos Exhibit 
This is a project that was done for my Multimedia Computing class that I've decided to continue working on. The goal was to create a simple, interactive, mobile-friendly webpage using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Bootstrap framework. I decided to continue improving the page as a way to practice and expand my knowledge on Bootstrap and jQuery.
